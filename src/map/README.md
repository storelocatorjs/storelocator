# Map provider API

The map provider's API allows you to extends the capabilities of `storelocatorjs` to map providers other than those included by default.

## Available map providers

Each map provider can be loaded on demand with the API.

| [Google Maps](./google-maps/README.md) | Support for Google Maps API |
| [Leaflet](./leaflet/README.md)         | Support for Leaflet API     |
| [Google Maps](./mapbox/README.md)      | Support for Mapbox API      |

## Create a custom provider

The Provider API allows you to create other providers than those referenced by `vLitejs`.

To start your new provider development, you can use the [sample-provider.js](https://github.com/vlitejs/vlite/blob/main/src/providers/sample/sample-provider.js) file which is made for you. You can also get inspiration from the [youtube.ts](https://github.com/vlitejs/vlite/blob/main/src/providers/youtube/youtube.ts) and [vimeo.ts](https://github.com/vlitejs/vlite/blob/main/src/providers/vimeo/vimeo.ts) provider files.

### Rules

Here are some points to help you in your development:

- The provider file should return a function that take as parameter `Player`.
- The function should return an ES6 JavaScript class that extends the `Player` parameter returned by the parent function.
- `vLitejs` should be available before the provider import.
- The `sample-provider.js` exposes all the necessary functions, do not rename or remove them because `vLitejs` will not recognize them.
- The `init` function is automatically called by `vLitejs` to initialize the provider.
- Call the `super.onReady()` function when the player is ready (the function is exposed by the parent class).
- Replace the content of the following functions with the appropriate code for the new provider (except `init` and `waitUntilVideoIsReady`).

### API and queue

Providers typically use an API/SDK. The provider file should load it and process the initialization queue.

There are two possible scenario:

- The API is already available: initialize the player (`initPlayer()`)
- The API is not available: push the instance into the queue (`providerQueue`)

At the end of the sample file, the queue is processed and each player initialized. Then call the `super.onReady()` function when the player is ready.
