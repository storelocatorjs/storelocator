# Storelocator Licenses

Storelocatorjs has three kinds of licenses: open-source, commercial, and OEM.

## Open source license

The open source license is designed for you to use Storelocatorjs to build open source and personal projects. The Storelocatorjs open source license is [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html). The GPLv3 has many terms, but the most important is how [it is sticky when you distribute your work publicly](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html#section5). From the [GPL FAQ](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic):

If you release the modified version to the public in some way, the GPL requires you to make the modified source code available to the program's users, under the GPL.

Releasing your project that uses Storelocatorjs under the GPLv3, in turn, requires your project to be licensed under the GPLv3. If you are okay with this, feel free to use Storelocatorjs under the GPLv3, without purchasing a commercial license.

## Commercial license

The commercial license is designed to for you to use Storelocator for an unlimited amount of applications during **ONE** year. With the commercial license, your code is kept propietary, to yourself. If you want to use Storelocator to develop commercial sites, themes, projects, and applications, the commercial license is the appropriate license.
